## PageRank algorithm

### Input: adjacency matrix of directed graph (sum of values in each column is equal to 1).

### Output: vector of rank vertices. 

<h2>4. Lab 4<h2>

## Polynomial interpolation

- Directly through the construction and solution of a system of linear equations.
- Lagrange polynomial.
- Newton polynomial. 

*User enters bounds of an interval and the number of interpolation nodes.*
